### Your soul is saying all these to you. Listen to it by closing your eyes. You will get answer to all your problems...believe me!

* You can make your own mindset. 
* You have got everything to become what you want to.
* You have to be the best in whatever you choose to do. Just focus on - **BE THE BEST, LEAVE THE REST**.
* God has given you immense and every capability ot realize any and every dream that you see or live.
* Everything that you need to succeed is there within you, that very few people possess.
* Improve yourself **NOT** for anyone, but for **YOURSELF**, for the betterment of the world.
* Make yourself the best to return the gift this earth and the world has given you.
* You have got a great purpose in life for which you took birth on this beautiful planet.
* Don't see what others are doing, what they are getting, but observe everything to make improvements to your ways.
* Even the sunflower changes its direction to face the sunlight to bear fruits. You too have to change the direction whenever needed in order to achieve what you want.
* If you know you deserve something, prove that to **YOURSELF** first because you are your biggest critic.
* If there's a problem that's coming up again and again and even if you are trying, there's something... just a `dx' which is missing, win over that `dx', and then see that no one can stop you.
* Accept your mistakes and sharpen the required weapon and rehit the problem until it fails to stand in front of you.
* I will get my name entered into the greatest Computer Scientists of all time (for Sai). Whatever I choose to do, I achieve it, though I fail 100 times, but I emerge as the winner. I lost to Maths once, but I will definitely win over this Computer Science that the world will watch.
* These downs come in the life of only those who aim to change the world. These are meant to prepare them for the struggles that will come later in life so that those battles later can be fought and won easily.
* My aim is not to be just satisfied by climbing a baby hill, but my I aim is to scale any mountain even higher than the Mount Everest.
* Even Edison failed a 1000 times to make the electric bulb he wanted to, with every failure he crossed out 1 more possible wrong way, and his final attempt was the one last possible solution which was bound to be the correct way out.
* Don't be saddened by the failures that come in your path, rather rejoice the fact that those failures are reducing your possibilities of failing further and that's bringing you one more step closer to your success everytime. Because there has to  be one day for sure when your last attempt will be the perfect way out for it.
* Dear...you are capable enough to bring yourself out of the mudpool in which you are stuck.
* Make use of your every single quality to become a person of worth, that will automatically make you successful.
* Do not look at what people are thinking about you, that's gonna pull you down, that's the work of people, to pull you down, because very few are there who can truly see you winning.
* Do not let the situation show you that you are losing, that's what it is meant to do. If it shows you your loss, tell it that this loss has taken you 1 more step closer to your goal and that it couldn't put you down, instead the situation only pushed you closer to your goal.
* If something is pulling you down, just smile back and put it in your heart that it never existed, because that smile and confidence of yours will slowly shatter the confidence of that problem and one day it will bow down to you and offer you the prize of your persistence in the form of your success. That 1 smile of yours can help you conquer the whole owrld, even your fear and your seemingly present problems.

### YOU ARE YOUR DESTINY AND IF YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE IT, NO FORCE CAN STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING. YOU ARE THE DESIGNER OF YOUR OWN LUCK!
